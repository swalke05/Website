			<h1>Tim Horton Children's Foundation</h1>
			<p> For my second co-op position, I worked at the Tim Horton Children's Foundation during the summer 2014 semester. The foundation is a non-profit organization that provides economically disadvantaged children with the opportunity to experience summer camp. Across Canada and USA there are six Foundation camps. Each camp provides programs that help campers develop lifelong skills which promote growth into becoming healthy individuals.<br><br>

The location I worked at this summer was the Onondaga Farms in St. George, Ontario. I worked as an IT consultant and reported to my boss who was the IT Manager. Rather than working as a team member in a call centre as I did at CCS, I was the only IT worker in the office aside from my boss, but we supported all six camps from our home office in St. George. My main responsibility was to resolve computer issues for the THCF staff in person, over the phone, or through remote assistance depending on which camp they were located at. I would escalate issues that required server maintenance to my manager, but the more common requests were handled by me. Some of these requests included mapping network drives, assisting with software problems and troubleshooting network connectivity issues. I also prepared workstations for THCF employees. I reimaged desktops that had been used by previous staff members and configured laptops for employees who were going on business trips.<br><br>

The Foundation is a great cause and I'm very glad I had the opportunity to work there. I worked with many wonderful people and got to participate in fun events. It was by far the most positive work environment I've experienced and I learned a lot during my time there.
