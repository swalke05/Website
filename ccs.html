			<h1>CCS Help Centre</h1>
			<p> My first co-op position was an 8-month term as a student consultant. I worked with other student staff members in a customer service role that provides technical troubleshooting and solutions to students, staff and faculty within the University. Although this is not a development job that would be typically chosen by a computer science student, related problem solving skills such as troubleshooting were essential for the job. Issues were sometimes as simple as helping individuals with basic computer usage, but could range in difficulty to problems with the operating system.<br><br>

In the Help Centre, my responsibility was to answer email requests and phone calls. Common issues I had to resolve included central login account access problems, internet connectivity, and email functionality. If the issue was something that we did not have the resources to resolve, we were responsible for documenting the issue before escalating it to one of the other departments within CCS. An example of this would be if we exhausted our troubleshooting resources for a ResNet connectivity issue to no avail, we would assign the ticket to the networking team.<br><br>

At the IT Help Desk, we had access to the ticketing system where we helped to monitor the request queue, but it was mostly used to log tickets of the interactions at the desk. The main focus at the desk was helping students with laptop troubles. The most common issues faced here were malware infections which we could usually remove with ease. Other problems included browser issues, operating sysem settings and other general problems that users would run into. Since the help desk is located in the library, the other most common requests were help with the library facilities such as the public desktops, printers and scanners. <br><br>
